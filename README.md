## Polishing experiment
This is a polishing project based on a UR robot and Optoforce F/T sensor.

The ROS driver is forked from [ThomasTimm](https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver) with small modification.
The kinemastic model is forked from [ros-industrial](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/indigo).
The ROS driver of the Optoforce sensor is forked from [Optoforce](https://github.com/OptoForce/etherdaq_ros)

# Notes
The *Simulink2C* fold is generated by a Matlab/Simulink project which is designed as a PI controller.

The *fake_etherdaq* fold contains a fake F/T sensor node to publish data as the *etherdaq_ros* node.
If you don't have a UR robot or a F/T sensor, download the [ur-sim](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/?option=27582#section16632) offline simulator to perform a kinematics simulation.
